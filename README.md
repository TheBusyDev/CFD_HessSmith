# Hess Smith Panel Method
A simple *CFD* method to compute __ideal flows__ around bodies.\
The core idea is to approximate the boundary of the body as a series of *sinks*, *sources* and *vortices*, computing the volume flow rate or the circulation for each of them. To complete these calculations, the *Kutta condition* is prescribed for the trailing edge.\
Then it's possible to find the __flow velocity field__ around the body. Here is an interesting example of the flow surrounding a wedge.\
